      <h2><i><u>Interest in IT</u></i></h2>

      <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
      <p>The thing that interests me to IT is the technological innovations and software development which make our pursuit of our life more simpler and comfortable. I feel that we are the most comfortable generation on the planet which is the direct result of IT, and i wish to take it forward. </p>
      <p>My interest in IT started with playing computer games back in the 90’s and burning music cd’s, downloading content from torrents, and subsequently after the mobile era, we saw a boom in IT related infrastructure around the world. Since then i have been closely following IT trends and love to read about new developments in AI and mobile technologies.</p>
      <p>I would say that what sparked my interest was my sister who graduated in IT and furthermore got a job working in the industry, she is the reason that i thought of pursuing this degree. </p>

      <h3>Why did you choose RMIT?</h3>
      <p>I chose RMIT because of the reputation that it enjoys amongst other universities. Moreover i have studied a few subjects at RMIT in the past while pursuing a bachelors in Electronic Engineering so i was familiar with the tools the university uses. Also, RMIT was the only uni in Melbourne which was offering this particular course which sparked my interest. </p>

      <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
      <p>I expect to be industry ready by the end of the course , wherein i develop skills such as programming, data analytics and networking which can facilitate me in trying to find a job in IT. </p>

        <h3>What do the result of these tests mean to you?</h3>
        <dd><p>I am not a big believer in personality tests, I feel that a persons personality is ever changing and it can shape as a person grows and learns in life. Moreover personality tests can have different results on different days depending on the way one is feeling at the time of taking the test. One can be trained to to do a certain type of a role, I strongly believe that the notion of passion is flawed and there is no such thing as a passion that you are born with, I believe that one develops passion for the things he/ she is into, For eg: If i start studying criminology or arts , i would develop a passion for that. Its more about taking pride in ones work and achievements. <br>
        For the sake of this assignment , i’d like to think that i am a logistician which has a certain truth to it , i like to analyse and plan accordingly, i like to follow steps and procedures, i like things clean and precise. I am unable to work in a directionless environment. </p></dd>

        <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

          <dd><p>I would not dwell too much upon the positives but try to work on the negatives of my results and try to improve on them when i am a team. According to my test , they vaguely indicate that i am an introvert and may have difficulty in social situations, based off that i would like to force myself to be more actively engaging with my peers, and not hesitate to communicate when required.</dd></p>

          <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>

          <dd><p>Based on the assessment of being a logistician , I can be the co- ordinator of the team where i can assign tasks help people to follow certain directions and code of conduct while working on the assignments. I can also take up tasks which involve abstract and complex ideas. </dd></p>

          <h2><i><u>Project Idea</u></i></h2>
          <h2><i>Inventory Management System</i></h2>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>I want to to be able to make a software solution which can be linked to POS system in a shop or a small restaurant and which will be able to record a businesses inventory and outgoing stock in an efficient manner, while inventory management systems exist for retail and warehouses, the usual practice of taking inventory in small businesses is manual  and cumbersome. <br>
          Based on the pos sale data and ingredients used in a recipe , this system will be able to identify the stock levels of both perishable and non perishable ingredients in a restaurant. </p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>There are 85000 restaurants in Australia  alone including takeaway and bars. Almost all of these restaurants still rely on manual stocktake using a pen and a paper which is performed by managers. <br>
                This is an inefficient and confusing process and almost always results in either ordering excessive stock which results in wastage or ordering less stock. <br>
                There can be upwards of 500 inventory items in a restaurant. For eg: An average house pantry alone may have more than 100 items. These not only include eatable items but items like packaging , coffee cups , takeaway boxes, freezer bags , day dots, cleaning chemicals etc. <br>
                There is a huge necessity to device an automated tool which is able to show the user its current stock levels and the projected levels that it may need from the suppliers. </p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This tool has an immense capability to not only make the users life easier but it can facilitate in cutting down costs and wastage and will be able to show the user an accurate data of his/her usage to a certain degree of tolerances. </p>

            <p><i><b>Working:</b></i></p>
            <p>Lets take an example of your local pizza shop named Cheesy Pizza
              This system will take the input data from the user in terms of its menu and ingredients in its inventory.<br>
              Now it will ask the user for individual ingredients and their ratios used to make a particular recipe, as an example , each pizza that the restaurant sells can have 100gram of cheese on it and one pizza uses one pizza box, so the user will input this data into the system. <br>
              Based on the data in the inventory system and the sale data in the already existing pos system, the system is able to show the level of stock to the consumer and do the reminding of ordering as well. <br>
              Now a restaurant may have upwards of 20 suppliers, and its a labour intensive task to be able to keep the records of each suppliers delivery dates and invoices, Moreover restaurants are mostly cramped for space and they need constant renewal of stock unlike a warehouse.<br>
              This system will also be able to tell if a certain ingredient or a beverage is being consumed more or less and based on that a restaurant can advertise itself or change its business strategies depending upon the likes of patrons.

              <p>"Interim data from a study conducted by Melbourne university, RMIT has revealed that at least 40 percent of food purchased for stock ends up in the bins of restaurants, cafes and other foodservice businesses around Australia." </p>

                        <blockquote cite="https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/">
                          <p>"US restaurants generate an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds of food waste each year.Kitchen culture and staff  behaviour such as over-preparation of food, improper ingredient storage and failure to use food scraps and trimmings can also contribute to food loss." </p>

                        </blockquote>

                        </figure>
<p>This system will reduce the food wastage in the kitchen substantially . </p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>This will be a software system will not need any hardware, It will simply be installed on the restaurants computer and would require integration with the its current pos system. <br>
It would require Developer Technologies , Version Control System, Issue tracking and Documentation, Some examples of these tools are Java, Python, Git, UX/UI design, Microsoft tools, IntelliJ Idea, Stack Overflow , Jira. Testing tools such as Selenium or Protractor. Open Source tools can include editors like Eclipse when programming in Java.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mathematical Aptitude & Problem Solving Skills</li>
  <dd><p>Software development might require algorithmic work, solving complex problems with graph theories , which means that a good mathematical background or at least, a basic understanding of such methods is key to performing well as a programmer.</dd></p>
  <li>Coding / Programming Skills</li>
  <dd><p>You must be able to build something from scratch but also improve and change existing software, which asks for a strong familiarity with programming languages and operating systems.</dd></p>
</ul>
<dd><p>Seeking skills and software will not be difficult, It would require someone with a strong experience and background and tertiary education in the field of IT.</dd></p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>This software can be has an immense selling potential since there are a number of buyers. This will solve the problem of tons of food waste and tons of man hours wasted doing tedious task. It will make inventory management more accurate and digital. This will also result in a better and more productive working environment for the user. It will streamline the supply chain and increase profits for a business. This has the potential to be one of the softwares which becomes industry standard. </p>
